# cement compressive strenght prediction

### This projects aims to predict the compressive strenght of the cement.

The compressive strength of the hardened cement is the essential property when water is added in the cement. Cement hydrates and shows cohesion and solidity. It binds all component together,i.e. cement, sand, aggregate etc. The strength of cement-based compound, such as mortar/concrete depends upon the type and nature of cement.
